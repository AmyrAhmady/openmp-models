# open.mp models

I'm currently only working on mobile UI so... yea...

There's barely anything interesting there yet, a responsive view, with a sidebar on desktop and a modal on phones. Also a good looking picker menu which looks horrible on desktop

But I've made a few components, to make all that work, so basically tried to make it component based.

(Yes, I know, I'm mixing functional components with class components, I haven't done a cleanup yet, I started this project and done this much of it through an all nighter)
